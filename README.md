# BaByliss Poland website and styleguide

This is something I prepered for BaByliss Poland — commissioned by Buzz. Agency. I've decided to put it out there in case someone would like to get to know how some things are done... I know I would like to know :)

Be kind to this repository and to the author. If you have any questions, fire away — you can find me on twitter [@ptrepka](http://twitter.com/ptrepka).

## What's what?
### Styleguide
  - Distibution
    - /dist/_basics.html — basic site elements (colors, type, grid etc.)
    - /dist/_complex.html — more advanced bits (grid cell types etc.)
  - Source
    - /src/styleguide/basics.md
    - /src/styleguide/complex.md

### Website
  - Distribution
    - /dist/*.html — examples of layouts
    - /dist/js/*.js — some vendor javascript goodies to make the site look and feel the way it should
    - /dist/js/main.js — my clunky javascript so the user can operate the site
    - /dist/css/*.css — compiled from SASS CSS magic in minized and compact version
  - Source
    - /src/sass/ — for the love of SASS browse and snoop ;)
