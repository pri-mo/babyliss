# BaByliss Poland website and styleguide

This is something I prepered for BaByliss Poland — commissioned by Buzz. Agency. I've decided to put it out there in case someone would like to get to know how some things are done... I know I would like to know :)

Be kind to this repository and to the author. If you have any questions, fire away — you can find me on twitter [@ptrepka](http://twitter.com/ptrepka).
